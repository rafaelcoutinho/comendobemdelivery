Web App for online food ordering

This is the source code of the ComendoBem Web app developed in 2009/2010 that was kept in production for about one year.
It had some users and restaurants on the Campinas (SP, Brazil) region. However the online delivery order market in Brazil was a new market, and needed to be formed and grow.

In end of 2011 the founders decided to shutdown the site. Two years later the online delivery order market got mature with iFood and other players.

The code is provided here for free.
